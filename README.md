# Dice_game
Weâ€™ve built a Dice Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a simple two-player game where both players roll a dice, and the player with the highest dice value wins. The project is fully functional and can be viewed live via GitHub Pages.

Feel free to explore the code or play the game at: (https://smruti030.github.io/Dice_game/).
